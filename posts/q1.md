Advent of Code 2022: Question 1, Part 1

Question 1 deals with finding the largest sum in a running group.

The example input shows

```sql
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
```

Where a space represents a delimiter between groups.

In the above example, we can see that 

`7000
8000
9000`

Produces the highest sum, and that sum is *`24000`.*

The question is to find the highest sum among the input given. 

## Preparation

Upon clicking into the input text, we can see that the input is exactly like the above sample input. This means that we can use Python’s `read()` function in its standard library, and the parsed text will automatically be converted to a list, super convenient!

So the first thing I did was create a helper function:

```py
def parseFile(filename):
  f = open(filename, 'r')

  text = f.read().split("\n")

  return text
```

This takes a filename and looks in the same directory as the script for it. It opens the file and reads the entire thing. Next, it splits everything by new lines (denoted by \n), and stores it all in a List. The list is then returned.
